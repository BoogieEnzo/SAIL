This appendix contains a grammar for the Sail language that is
automatically generated from the
https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir[Menhir] parser definition.

NOTE: This means that the grammar is stated in such a way that the
parser generator can see it is free of LR shift/reduce and
reduce/reduce conflicts, rather than being optimised for human
readability.

First, we need some lexical conventions:

* `ID` is any valid Sail identifier

* `OPERATOR` is any valid Sail operator, as defined in <<Operators>>.

* `TYPE_VARIABLE` is a valid Sail identifier with a leading single quote `'`.

* `NUMBER` is a non-empty sequence of decimal digits `[0-9]+`.

* `HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL` is `0x[A-Ba-f0-9_]+`

* `BINARY_LITERAL` is `0b[0-1_]+`

* `STRING_LITERAL` is a Sail string literal.

`$[ATTRIBUTE]` and `$LINE_DIRECTIVE` represent attributes and line
directives. Examples of line directives would be things like
`$include`, `$ifdef` and so on.

An attribute starts with `$[` and ends with `]`, and in between
consists of an attribute name, optionally followed by some structured
_attribute data_. This attribute data is similar in structure to JSON
(except without null).

Line directives start with a leading `$`, followed by the directive
name (following the same lexical rules as Sail identifiers), then one
or more spaces, before proceeding to the end of the line. Everything
between the identifier and the line ending is the line directive's
argument (with leading and trailing whitespace removed). If a line
directive identifier is followed by a `{` it is a _structured line
directive_, and can span multiple lines. It contains the same
JSON-like attribute data as for attributes.
