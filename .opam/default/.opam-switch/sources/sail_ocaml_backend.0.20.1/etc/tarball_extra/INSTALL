To use this binary release of Sail, simply add the included bin
directory to your $PATH variable, or symlink the included binaries
from a directory already in your $PATH. By default it should know
where to find the included Sail libraries and plugins relative to this
directory.

If you want to move the binaries you will need to set the $SAIL_DIR
environment variable to the included share/sail folder, and the
$SAIL_PLUGIN_DIR variable to the share/libsail/plugins folder.
